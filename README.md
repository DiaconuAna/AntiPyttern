# AntiPyttern

_AntiPyttern_ is a static analysis tool designed to identify antipatterns in Python code. It supports the detection of three antipatterns (Blob, Spaghetti Code, and Swiss Army Knife) defined by Brown et al. and can analyze code from a GitHub repository, a Python project directory, or an individual Python file, as specified by the user. The detection process is based on identifying underlying code smells described by Fowler, with metrics derived from these smells forming the basis of the antipattern identification heuristics.
